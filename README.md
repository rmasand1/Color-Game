# Color-Game

This is a simple project to demonstrate a Color Matching game using HTML, CSS and Javascript.

The game helps us understand the working of the RGB color scheme. 

How it works:
1: The landing page consists of 6 colors(HARD selected by default) and a RGB color.
2: You can pick the right color according to the value.
3: If you pick the right color, it allows you to play again.
4: There is also an option of choosing  EASY level which has 3 colors and works the same way.
5: You can opt for new colors anywhere in the game.

Note: This coding exercise is done as a part of Web Developer Bootcamp course on Udemy.com
The purpose is to be able to learn to seperate the functionality of HTML, CSS and Javascript.
